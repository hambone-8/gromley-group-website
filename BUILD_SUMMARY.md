## 🎯 Key Design Decisions

### Why These Choices?

**Next.js App Router**: Modern, fast, great SEO, automatic optimization

**Tailwind CSS**: Rapid development, consistent design system, easy to customize

**Framer Motion**: Smooth animations that enhance (not distract from) content

**Resend**: Simple, reliable email delivery with generous free tier

**TypeScript**: Catches errors early, better developer experience

### Mobile-First Approach

Every component was designed for mobile first, then enhanced for larger screens. The hamburger menu keeps the header clean while keeping CTAs visible without scrolling.

### Accessibility Focus

Built-in keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and reduced motion preferences ensure everyone can use the site.

### Conversion Optimization

- Clear value proposition in hero
- Prominent CTAs (Request a Quote)
- Trust signals (venues, testimonials)
- Simple 3-step process
- Low-friction contact form
- Different messaging for clients vs musicians
