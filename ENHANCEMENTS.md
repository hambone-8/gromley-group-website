# ðŸš€ Future Enhancements

This document outlines optional features you can add to the website after launch.

## High Priority (Quick Wins)

### 1. Add Email Field to Contact Form

**Current:** The contact form only sends an email to you, not to the submitter.

**Enhancement:** Add an email input field so you can send auto-responders to clients/musicians.

**How to implement:**

1. Update `/components/ContactForm.tsx`:
```tsx
// Add after inquiryType state
const [email, setEmail] = useState("");

// Add in the form, after the dropdown:
<div>
  <label htmlFor="email" className="block text-sm font-medium text-text mb-2">
    Your email address
  </label>
  <input
    type="email"
    id="email"
    value={email}
    onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}
    required
    className="w-full px-4 py-3 rounded-md border border-muted bg-background text-text"
    placeholder="you@example.com"
  />
</div>

// Update the fetch body to include email
body: JSON.stringify({ inquiryType, message, email, honeypot })
```

2. Update `/app/api/contact/route.ts`:
```tsx
// Add email to the body destructuring
const { inquiryType, message, email, honeypot } = body;

// Validate email
if (!email || !email.includes('@')) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: "Valid email required" }, { status: 400 });
}

// After sending business email, send auto-responder:
await resend.emails.send({
  from: "The Gromley Group <noreply@thegromleygroup.com>",
  to: email,
  subject: inquiryType === "client" 
    ? "We received your inquiry - The Gromley Group"
    : "Thanks for your interest - The Gromley Group",
  html: autoResponderTemplate,
});
```

**Benefit:** Automated confirmation emails build trust and set expectations.
